Ken dropped from the quarter
I've spent couple of hours to finish 110Lab.
I've also been a bit burnout due to the basketball league game I played in yester day:W with 39:12 minutes
Need to rest up and recharge before doing more work.
Hopefully I can be fully chargedup tomorrow for the challenging week!
